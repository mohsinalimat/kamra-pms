Run your hotel with AI agents you control — on infrastructure you own.</p>

## Why we built this

Most hotel PMS software was built twenty years ago and has barely moved since. Dozens of options, almost no innovation: the same click-heavy screens, the same nightly rituals, the same walls around your own data.

Hotels deserve better than:

- **Per-room, per-module rent.** Your software bill grows every time your hotel does. Night audit is an add-on. Reports are an add-on. The booking engine is an add-on.
- **Your data held hostage.** Guest history, rate history, your books — locked in a vendor's cloud, with an export fee if you ever try to leave.
- **Waiting for AI that never ships.** Legacy vendors bolt a chatbot onto 2005-era software and call it innovation. Real agentic operations need a system *designed* for agents.
- **Integration purgatory.** Every connection is a paid interface, a certification queue, a quarter of waiting.
- **Trained-staff-only software.** If a new hire needs a week of training to check someone in, the software failed — not the hire.

**Kamra is the answer we wanted to exist:** a full property management system where every operation — booking, check-in, folios, night audit, pricing — is a governed action an AI agent can perform, with the owner's guardrails enforced by the system, not by hope.

## What makes Kamra different

- **AI & agent native, MCP-first.** Kamra ships an [MCP server](mcp/kamra_mcp.py) with 17+ tools. Connect Claude (or any MCP client) and say *"book Mr. Rao a deluxe for the weekend with breakfast"* — the agent quotes, books, and logs it. Agents are just users: role-scoped, permission-checked, fully audited.
- **Bring your own key.** No bundled AI markup, no model lock-in. Point your own LLM at Kamra's tool surface.
- **Deterministic money.** Prices, taxes, availability come from a pricing engine — never from a language model. GST slabs, multi-rate invoices, and the no-overbooking guard are code, verified by an eval suite in CI.
- **Autonomy with rails.** Owners set rate floors/ceilings and approval thresholds; agents literally cannot price outside them. Every automated action records the minutes it saved — ROI is a dashboard, not a promise.
- **Truly free.** AGPL-licensed. No per-room pricing, no per-user seats, no license audits. Self-host on-prem or on any cloud.
- **Built on Frappe.** The framework behind ERPNext — one of the world's largest open-source ERPs — with its mature ecosystem: RBAC, audit trails, multi-tenancy, the frappe/payments gateway app, and a huge developer community.

## Quickstart (development)

```bash
bench init --frappe-branch v16.25.0 frappe-bench && cd frappe-bench
bench get-app payments
bench get-app kamra https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/pms
bench new-site kamra.localhost --admin-password admin
bench --site kamra.localhost install-app kamra
bench serve --port 8000
cd apps/kamra/frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # UI on :5173
```

Seed demo data, roles and users: see `kamra/scripts/` (run via `bench console`). Full dev notes: [docs-dev.md](docs-dev.md).

Connect an AI agent:

```bash
claude mcp add kamra -e KAMRA_URL=... -e KAMRA_API_KEY=... \
  -e KAMRA_API_SECRET=... -- python mcp/kamra_mcp.py
```

## For hotel owners

You own the software, the server, and every byte of your data. Costs don't scale with your room count. Your AI front desk works from day one — and if you ever want managed hosting or AI staff (voice, WhatsApp) on top, those are choices, not ransoms.

## For IT teams

Standard Python (Frappe) + React. Real RBAC, real audit trails, documented REST + MCP surfaces, an eval suite in CI, no black boxes. Fork it, extend it, ship your own modules — that's the point.

## License

AGPL-3.0 — free forever. Anyone offering Kamra as a hosted service must share their modifications back, which keeps the ecosystem honest.
