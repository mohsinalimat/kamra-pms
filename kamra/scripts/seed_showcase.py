"""Seed showcase experiences and venues onto an existing demo property so
the booking engine and events diary look like a living resort.

Run with:
    bench --site <site> execute kamra.scripts.seed_showcase.execute

Idempotent: each experience/venue is keyed by (property, name); re-running
adds only what's missing, never duplicates.
