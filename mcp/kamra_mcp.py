"""Kamra MCP server — connect Claude (or any MCP client) to your hotel.

Every tool wraps a governed Kamra API endpoint. The server authenticates
as a dedicated agent user (scoped role, full audit trail), so the AI can
never do more than the hotel allowed it to.

Setup:
    uv add "mcp[cli]" requests      # or: pip install "mcp[cli]" requests

Env:
    KAMRA_URL         e.g. http://kamra.localhost:8000
    KAMRA_API_KEY     from kamra.scripts.seed_rbac_v2
    KAMRA_API_SECRET  from kamra.scripts.seed_rbac_v2
    KAMRA_PROPERTY    default property name

Connect Claude Code:
    claude mcp add kamra -e KAMRA_URL=... -e KAMRA_API_KEY=... \
        -e KAMRA_API_SECRET=... -e KAMRA_PROPERTY=... \
        -- uv run /path/to/kamra_mcp.py
