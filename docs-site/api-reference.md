# REST API reference

Every endpoint below is a whitelisted function — the same governed layer
the UI and the AI use. **146 endpoints**, generated from the source
(`docs-site/gen_api.py`), so this page always matches the code.

## Calling convention

```
POST https://<your-kamra>/api/method/kamra.<module>.<function>
Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>
Content-Type: application/json
```

- Get keys from **Copilot → Connect** (per-user, role-scoped) or the
  dedicated agent user for services.
- Responses: `{"message": <return value>}`. Errors are HTTP 4xx with a
  readable reason.
- **Try it in Postman:** [download the collection](/kamra.postman_collection.json),
  set `base_url`, `api_key` and `api_secret` collection variables, go.
- Endpoints marked **public** are `allow_guest` (no token; rate-limited).


## Core (front desk, folios, guests, rooms)

### `kamra.api.whoami` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Current user + roles - drives which modules the UI shows.

allow_guest so the SPA's initial "am I logged in?" probe returns
{user: "Guest"} cleanly instead of a 403 in the console.

### `kamra.api.developer_info`

**GET/POST** · roles: `System Manager`, `Administrator`

REST base URL + whether the current user already has an API key.

Drives the on-site Developers page. The secret itself is never returned
here - Frappe stores it hashed; it's only shown once, at generation time.

### `kamra.api.generate_api_key`

**POST** · roles: `System Manager`, `Administrator`

Generate (or rotate) the current user's REST API key + secret.

Self-service: acts only on the signed-in user, so any authenticated staff
member can mint a key scoped to their own roles. The secret is returned
once here and stored hashed thereafter.

### `kamra.api.set_room_rate`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Revenue Manager`, `Kamra Agent`

Set the nightly rate for a room type over a date range - bounded by

### `kamra.public_api.precheckin_submit` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**POST**

Guest completes pre-arrival check-in and signs the registration card
(PRD FR-20 - details + declaration + e-signature; the signed card becomes
the paperless GRC the desk views at arrival). ID photo/KYC vendor
integration comes later.

### `kamra.public_api.check_voucher` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Live promo-code feedback on the booking page. Never throws - returns
{ok, message, discount_type, value} so the guest sees a friendly note.

### `kamra.public_api.qr_menu` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

The guest-facing digital menu behind a table/room QR code. Only shows
outlets a hotel has published items for; no prices are trusted from the
guest - they're read here.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `outlet` | yes |  |

### `kamra.public_api.qr_order` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**POST**

A guest places an order from the QR menu. It lands as a QR order that
a captain must confirm before it fires to the kitchen or touches a bill -
the guest can never post directly to a folio.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `items` | yes |  |
| `room` | no | `None` |
| `table_no` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.public_api.hosting_enquiry` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**POST**

Kamra Cloud hosting enquiry from kamrapms.com. Stored first (a lead is
never lost even without SMTP), then a best-effort email to the team.

| Param | Required | Default |
