# REST API reference

Every endpoint below is a whitelisted function — the same governed layer
the UI and the AI use. **178 endpoints**, generated from the source
(`docs-site/gen_api.py`), so this page always matches the code.

## Calling convention

```
POST https://<your-kamra>/api/method/kamra.<module>.<function>
Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>
Content-Type: application/json
```

- Get keys from **Copilot → Connect** (per-user, role-scoped) or the
  dedicated agent user for services.
- Responses: `{"message": <return value>}`. Errors are HTTP 4xx with a
  readable reason.
- **Try it in Postman:** [download the collection](/kamra.postman_collection.json),
  set `base_url`, `api_key` and `api_secret` collection variables, go.
- Endpoints marked **public** are `allow_guest` (no token; rate-limited).


## Core (front desk, folios, guests, rooms)

### `kamra.api.whoami` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Current user + roles - drives which modules the UI shows.

allow_guest so the SPA's initial "am I logged in?" probe returns
{user: "Guest"} cleanly instead of a 403 in the console.

### `kamra.api.developer_info`

**GET/POST** · roles: `System Manager`, `Administrator`

REST base URL + whether the current user already has an API key.

Drives the on-site Developers page. The secret itself is never returned
here - Frappe stores it hashed; it's only shown once, at generation time.

### `kamra.api.generate_api_key`

**POST** · roles: `System Manager`, `Administrator`

Generate (or rotate) the current user's REST API key + secret.

Self-service: acts only on the signed-in user, so any authenticated staff
member can mint a key scoped to their own roles. The secret is returned
once here and stored hashed thereafter.

### `kamra.api.set_room_rate`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Revenue Manager`, `Kamra Agent`

Set the nightly rate for a room type over a date range - bounded by
the owner's Rate Guardrails (PRD FR-30). This is the Revenue Agent's
write tool: it can never price outside the rails.

Guardrails still clamp the rate; the change is recorded in the action log.

Bulk booking import - the switch-over tool. Each row: {guest_name,
phone?, room_type_code, check_in, check_out, adults?, children?,
amount_after_tax?, channel?, status?}. Rows with a fixed amount keep

User Permissions, so a property-restricted user sees only theirs.

command palette can jump straight from 'INV-KDP-26-00042' to the bill.

| Param | Required | Default |

| `query` | no | `None` |

booker and the actions currently available. Powers the reservation drawer.

### `kamra.api.upload_id_document`

**POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Kamra Agent`

Capture the guest's ID at the counter, when they never uploaded one.

Same storage as the guest path, different gate: there the token proves
ownership, here @require_roles does. This exists so that "never block
check-in" has somewhere to go - the desk flags a missing document, then
fixes it in the same breath instead of turning the guest away.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reservation` | yes |  |
| `data` | yes |  |

### `kamra.api.id_document_image`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Kamra Agent`

The ID scan as a data URL, for the desk to eyeball.

Why not just point an &lt;img> at the /private/files/ URL: Frappe would
authorise that through File.has_permission -> the Reservation's own
doctype permissions. On a site whose Custom DocPerm rows omit Front Desk
(as ours do - any custom perm on a doctype REPLACES all its standard
perms), that check says no, and the desk gets a broken image while a
Hotel Admin sees it. Kamra's authorization has always lived on the
endpoint rather than the doctype (see authz.py), so the image is served
the same way as everything else here: one gate, one rule, works for
every role the app actually grants.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reservation` | yes |  |

### `kamra.api.verify_precheckin`

**POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Kamra Agent`

The desk has held the document against the human and agrees.

This is the write that finally makes precheckin_status="Verified" real -
the enum has existed since pre-arrival check-in shipped and no code path
ever set it. precheckin_submit already refuses to touch a Verified
booking, so the guest is locked out of rewriting a checked card the
moment this lands; that guard was clearly written for this.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reservation` | yes |  |

### `kamra.api.check_in`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Kamra Agent`

| Param | Required | Default |

| --- | --- | --- |

**POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Kamra Agent`

Set the planned arrival (ETA) and departure (ETD) times for any stay.
These drive the hotel-position view on the tape chart: back-to-back

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |

**POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Finance`, `Revenue Manager`, `Housekeeping`

Personal MCP credentials for connecting Claude (or any MCP client)
AS YOURSELF. The key acts with exactly your roles - Frappe enforces the

### `kamra.pos.create_order`

**GET/POST**

The table view a captain starts from: every table at the outlet with
its live state - vacant, running (open bill), fired (KOT in the kitchen)
or ready (everything prepared, awaiting service/settle). A table holds
any number of bills (separate parties, split bills); the tile carries
them all and shows the most urgent state.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `outlet` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.reserve_table`

**POST**

Reserve a table - it shows as Reserved on the map from an hour

| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `table_no` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.recent_orders`

captain can jump back to a running bill or reprint a settled one.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `limit` | no | `8` |

### `kamra.pos.split_order`

**POST**

Split a bill: move the chosen lines to a new bill on the same table
(or a named one) - separate bills for two parties sharing a table, or
one party paying separately. Fired lines keep their kitchen status, and
the two bills conserve the original total.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `item_rows` | yes |  |
| `table_no` | no | `None` |

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |

| Param | Required | Default |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `amount` | yes |  |
| `reason` | no | `''` |

### `kamra.pos.fire_kot`

**POST**

Send the order to the kitchen: new lines become Fired and show on the
kitchen display. Stamps the KOT number (a daily sequence per outlet) and
returns just-fired lines so the till can print the thermal KOT ticket.

Pass a course to send only that course and hold the rest - the table
orders once, the kitchen cooks the mains when the starters are cleared.
Each line is stamped with the moment it was fired: that, not when the
captain opened the tab, is when the cook's clock starts.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `course` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.pos.kitchen_queue`

**GET/POST**

The kitchen display: fired orders the kitchen still has work on. Scope
to one outlet (each restaurant's own kitchen) and/or one station.

Each line carries a `state` the screen renders directly:
  cooking   - fired, still to make
  held      - a later course, or a round added to a running tab; the
              kitchen can see it coming but must not start it
  cancelled - voided after the KOT fired; the chef may be cooking it right
              now, so it stays on the ticket (loudly) until acknowledged
  done      - already prepared; kept for context and to allow a recall

A ticket is on the board while it has cooking, held or cancelled lines.
Done lines ride along but never hold a ticket open, so "all ready" still
clears it.

`fired_at` per line is what the display ages against - a table that sat an
hour over drinks must not hand the kitchen a ticket that is already red.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | no | `None` |
| `station` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.pos.mark_prepared`

**POST**

Kitchen marks one line (or every cooking line) prepared. Voided lines
are never swept up by "all ready" - that food is cancelled, not cooked.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `item_row` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.pos.accept_ticket`

**POST**

The kitchen takes the ticket on. Until a ticket is accepted the floor
has no evidence anyone has seen it - a KOT can print to an empty pass.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.recall_prepared`

**POST**

Undo a mark-prepared: the line goes back to Fired and reappears on the
display. A mis-tap on a greasy touchscreen must not be one-way.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `item_row` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.pos.acknowledge_void`

**POST**

it; drop it from the display. The void itself stays on the order.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `item_row` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.deliver_order`

(controller) when there's a linked stay.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.pay_order`

**POST**

Settle a bill at the outlet (walk-ins, takeaway - or a guest who'd
rather pay now than post to the room). Records the payment mode and
closes the order without touching any folio.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `mode` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.mark_nc`

**POST**

Mark a bill NC (no charge / complimentary). Needs who authorized it
(captain, chef, GM, management…) and takes a free-text reference (the
occasion, the complaint ticket, the promise made). The items still fire
to the kitchen and print on the KOT - the bill just closes at zero and
never touches a folio. `undo=1` lifts it.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `authorized_by` | yes |  |
| `note` | no | `''` |
| `undo` | no | `0` |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `reason` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.void_item`

**POST**

through, amount zero) so the KOT-vs-bill audit holds up.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |
| `item_row` | yes |  |
| `reason` | yes |  |

### `kamra.pos.bill_data`

live lines, the discount, and the CGST/SGST split at the outlet's rate.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `order` | yes |  |

### `kamra.laundry.deliver_laundry`

**POST**

Hand the bag back and bill the stay. If pieces are still pending, a
shortage note is required - the discrepancy is recorded, never silent.
Posting rides the governed agent path (HK can only bill laundry).

| `order` | yes |  |
| `reason` | yes |  |

### `kamra.laundry.laundry_board`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Finance`

Everything the floor and the desk need at a glance: open bags by
status with piece counts and what's still pending, plus the last few
delivered ones for reprints/queries.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |

### `kamra.laundry.laundry_revenue`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Finance`, `Front Desk`, `Hotel Admin`, `Kamra Agent`

Delivered-laundry revenue over the last N days, with a per-service
breakdown. Only billed guest orders count as revenue; House and
complimentary bags are counted as volume but earn nothing.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `days` | no | `30` |


## Migration (CSV import)

### `kamra.migrate.preview_import`

**POST**

Dry run: how the file's columns map, which date convention was
detected, and every row that would be skipped - nothing is written.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `csv_text` | yes |  |
| `preset` | no | `'auto'` |

### `kamra.migrate.run_import`

**POST**

Import the file. Live rows (confirmed / in-house) go through the
full booking validation; history rows (checked-out / cancelled /
no-show) are stored as records with their status stamped directly, so
guest history survives the migration.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `csv_text` | yes |  |
| `preset` | no | `'auto'` |


## Inventory & recipes

### `kamra.inventory.ingredients`

**GET/POST**

The ingredient master - the picker behind the recipe editor.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `active_only` | no | `1` |

### `kamra.inventory.menu_recipe`

**GET/POST**

One dish's recipe, with each line's unit and what the dish's own outlet
has on hand right now - so the editor can say "you have 0.4 kg left".

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `menu_item` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.recipe_overview`

**GET/POST**

Every dish and whether it has a recipe yet. Dishes without one are not
a problem to be nagged about - most menus will only ever cost their big
movers - but you cannot decide that without seeing the list.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.save_recipe`

**POST** · roles: `Finance`, `Hotel Admin`

Replace a dish's recipe wholesale. An empty list is valid and means
"this dish never touches inventory" - the optional in the requirement.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `menu_item` | yes |  |
| `rows` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.save_ingredient`

**POST**

Create or update one ingredient.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `ingredient_name` | yes |  |
| `uom` | yes |  |
| `category` | no | `None` |
| `cost_per_unit` | no | `0` |
| `is_active` | no | `1` |
| `name` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.inventory.delete_ingredient`

**POST**

Refuse if it is on a recipe or has history - deleting it would orphan a
recipe or punch a hole in the ledger. Deactivate instead.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.receive_stock`

**POST**

Goods in. rows = [{ingredient, qty, cost_per_unit?}]. One batch_id ties
the delivery together, which is why this needs no Stock Receipt doctype:
a receipt is just its ledger rows plus a supplier and an invoice number.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `rows` | yes |  |
| `supplier` | no | `None` |
| `invoice_no` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.inventory.adjust_stock`

**POST**

The stock take, and the escape hatch for everything this module cannot
know. rows = [{ingredient, counted_qty}] - COUNTS, not deltas, exactly
like laundry's return_items: a human reports what is physically on the
shelf and the system works out its own error.

The note is required on purpose. A write-off with no reason is precisely
the silence this module exists to remove - the same call laundry's
shortage guard makes when it refuses to deliver a short bag unexplained.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `rows` | yes |  |
| `note` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.record_wastage`

**POST**

Stock destroyed OUTSIDE a sale: a crate of tomatoes rots, a bottle
breaks. No POS line exists, so only a real ledger row can say it happened.

Note what this is NOT for: food that was cooked and then voided. That
already left the shelf at fire and already has its Consumed row - writing
a Wastage row too would deduct it twice. Use wastage_report() for those.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `ingredient` | yes |  |
| `qty` | yes |  |
| `reason_note` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.stock_list`

**GET/POST**

Everything this outlet holds. Stock is per outlet, so there is no such
thing as a merged total across outlets and this never offers one.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `status` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.inventory.ingredient_ledger`

**GET/POST**

Where did my paneer go? Newest first, each row carrying the balance it
produced, so the history explains the number on the shelf.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `ingredient` | yes |  |
| `limit` | no | `50` |

### `kamra.inventory.low_stock`

**GET/POST**

Everything at or under par, out, or negative - and, for each, the
dishes that use it. That last part is what makes the flag actionable:
"Paneer is out" means nothing until you know it takes Paneer Tikka with
it. We flag and offer; a human decides. Nothing is ever auto-86'd.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.inventory.wastage_report`

**GET/POST**

Food that was cooked and then binned: lines voided after they fired.

Derived, deliberately. The stock already left at the fire and the Consumed
row is the truth - a second Wastage row would deduct it twice, and a
compensating pair would churn the ledger without changing a balance. This
only asks which of those consumptions turned out to be waste, and what
they cost. reason="Wastage" in the ledger stays reserved for stock
destroyed outside a sale, so SUM(qty_change) always equals reality.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | no | `None` |
| `days` | no | `30` |

### `kamra.inventory.set_menu_availability`

**POST** · roles: `Finance`, `Hotel Admin`

86 a dish, or put it back. This is the ONLY thing that ever pulls an
item off the menu for stock reasons, and a human has to press it.

Nothing auto-86s on a zero balance, deliberately: the count is the least
trustworthy number in the building (see this module's docstring), and a
stale one would silently hide a dish the kitchen can actually cook. The
screen flags what is out and offers the button; the decision stays with
someone who can walk over and look at the shelf.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `menu_item` | yes |  |
| `available` | yes |  |

### `kamra.inventory.set_par_level`

**POST**

Where LOW starts for this ingredient at this outlet. Zero = no par.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `ingredient` | yes |  |
| `par_level` | yes |  |


## Menu bulk import

### `kamra.menu_import.preview_menu_import`

**POST**

Dry run: how the columns map, what would be created vs updated, and
every row that would be skipped. Nothing is written.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `csv_text` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.menu_import.run_menu_import`

**POST**

Import the file. Upserts by (property, outlet, item_name): a dish
already on that outlet's menu is updated (price/flags), never duplicated.
One bad row never aborts the batch.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `csv_text` | yes |  |
| `outlet` | no | `None` |
| `update_existing` | no | `1` |

### `kamra.menu_import.menu_template`

**GET/POST**

The CSV headers + one sample row, so the file starts out right.

| `from_date` | yes |  |

| `by` | no | `'source'` |

### `kamra.reports.sla_report`

**GET/POST** · roles: `Front Desk`, `Hotel Admin`, `Kamra Agent`

Operations SLA health from Service Tickets over a window: overall
resolution and breach rates, a breakdown by category and by priority,

## Public (no auth - booking page, QR menu)

> These are allow_guest endpoints: no token needed, rate-limited.

### `kamra.public_api.site_info` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Public site metadata for the login/boot screen.

demo_mode is true only on the seeded demo site (seed_demo sets the
`kamra_demo_mode` default), so a real install never advertises the
demo login accounts.

### `kamra.public_api.showcase` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Everything the public booking page needs to render.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |

### `kamra.public_api.search_stay` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Availability + real quoted price per room type for the stay.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `check_in_date` | yes |  |
| `check_out_date` | yes |  |
| `adults` | no | `2` |

### `kamra.public_api.precheckin_info` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Stay summary for the pre-arrival check-in page.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | yes |  |

### `kamra.public_api.precheckin_upload_id` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**POST**

The guest photographs their ID during pre-arrival check-in.

Deliberately NOT Frappe's upload_file. That endpoint would need the
site-wide `allow_guests_to_upload_files` setting, which opens
unauthenticated upload to the whole site; on its guest branch it sets
ignore_permissions and never sees a token, so it cannot tell whether this
guest owns this booking; and it takes is_private from the client - i.e.
it trusts the browser to protect an Aadhaar scan. Here the token is the
gate, the rate limit is real, and privacy is not negotiable.

Optional by design: nothing downstream requires a document. A guest with
a cracked camera or a bad lobby connection must still be able to
pre-register, so the submit gate never mentions this.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | yes |  |
| `data` | yes |  |

### `kamra.public_api.laundry_info` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Laundry price list + stay context for the in-stay guest page.
Read-only — the guest sees what things cost, never a folio.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | yes |  |

### `kamra.public_api.request_guest_laundry` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**POST**

In-house guest asks housekeeping to pick their laundry up. Written on
the guest's behalf by the governed agent — the guest never touches pricing
or the folio; staff count and price the bag at the door (status
'Requested', exactly where a staff-logged pickup lands).

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | yes |  |
| `notes` | no | `''` |
| `express` | no | `0` |

### `kamra.public_api.check_voucher` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

Live promo-code feedback on the booking page. Never throws - returns
{ok, message, discount_type, value} so the guest sees a friendly note.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | yes |  |
| `code` | yes |  |
| `nights` | no | `1` |

### `kamra.public_api.qr_menu` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**GET/POST**

The guest-facing digital menu behind a table/room QR code. Only shows
outlets a hotel has published items for; no prices are trusted from the
guest - they're read here.

| Param | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `outlet` | yes |  |

### `kamra.public_api.qr_order` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

**POST**

A guest places an order from the QR menu. It lands as a QR order that
a captain must confirm before it fires to the kitchen or touches a bill -
the guest can never post directly to a folio.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `outlet` | yes |  |
| `items` | yes |  |
| `room` | no | `None` |
| `table_no` | no | `None` |

### `kamra.public_api.hosting_enquiry` <Badge type='tip' text='public' />

never lost even without SMTP), then a best-effort email to the team.
