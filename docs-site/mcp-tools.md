# MCP tool reference

The Kamra MCP server (`mcp/kamra_mcp.py`) exposes these tools. Every call
runs as the connected user — role permissions apply, prices come from the
pricing engine, and each action is recorded in the activity ledger.


### `front_desk_today()`

Today's snapshot: arrivals, departures, in-house guests, room board
    and the hours-saved counter.


### `availability(start_date, days)`

Room availability and nightly rates per room type for the next N
    days. start_date YYYY-MM-DD (default today).


### `quote(room_type, check_in_date, check_out_date, adults, children, meal_plan, voucher_code)`

Price a stay (deterministic: occupancy pricing, seasons, meal plan,
    voucher, GST). Use before every booking.


### `booking_options()`

Room types, meal plans, rate plans and corporate accounts available
    for booking at this property.


### `create_booking(guest_name, room_type, check_in_date, check_out_date, phone, adults, children, meal_plan, voucher_code)`

Create a reservation. Dedupes the guest by phone, auto-assigns a
    free room, applies the voucher, prices via the engine.


### `add_to_waitlist(guest_name, room_type, check_in_date, check_out_date, phone, adults, children)`

Park a stay on the waitlist (no room) — for dates that are sold out or
    restricted. Promote it later with promote_waitlist when a room frees.


### `waitlist_ready()`

Waitlisted stays that can NOW be booked — a room has freed up for their
    dates. Each item includes the guest name and phone, so you can proactively
    reach out. Poll this to catch openings the moment they appear — the wedge
    for turning a sold-out 'no' into a booking.


### `promote_waitlist(reservation)`

Promote a waitlisted stay into a free room (Confirmed). Fails if no room
    is free for its dates.


### `cancellation_preview(reservation)`

What cancelling would cost right now (policy window, fee basis,
    estimated fee). ALWAYS read this to the guest before cancelling.


### `cancel_booking(reservation, reason, note, waive_fee)`

Cancel a confirmed booking. The property's cancellation policy
    applies automatically — free outside the window, else the configured
    fee posts to the folio. Returns a cancellation number — always give
    it to the guest. Reasons: Guest request, Change of plans, Duplicate
    booking, Payment failed, Weather / travel disruption, Booked
    elsewhere, Other. Only waive the fee when a manager authorizes it;
    the waiver is logged.


### `check_in(reservation, room)`

Check a guest in (opens their folio, marks the room occupied).


### `check_out(reservation)`

Check a guest out (posts remaining nights to the folio, frees the
    room, queues housekeeping). Confirm with the user first.


### `guest_lookup(search)`

Find guests by name or phone, with stay stats and lifetime value.


### `guest_journey(guest)`

A guest's full history: profile, stats, chronological timeline.
    Load this before talking to a returning guest.


### `create_ticket(subject, category, priority, room, description)`

Log a guest request / issue as a tracked ticket. Categories:
    Housekeeping, Room Service, Maintenance, Front Desk, Concierge,
    Complaint, Other. Priority sets the SLA.


### `list_tickets(show_closed)`

Open service tickets with SLA/overdue status.


### `get_folio(reservation)`

The guest's bill: charge lines, payments, GST, balance.


### `add_folio_charge(folio, charge_type, description, amount, gst_rate)`

Post a charge to an open folio (F&B, minibar, laundry, late
    checkout…). Amount is pre-tax.


### `post_stay_charge(reservation, charge_type, description, amount, gst_rate, is_alcohol)`

Post a charge to a stay and let the company billing rules pick the
    folio — corporate room/meals go to the Company folio, alcohol and
    unruled charges to the guest. Prefer this over add_folio_charge when
    you don't know which folio should carry the line.


### `group_billing(group_booking)`

A group's whole billing picture: the consolidated company (master)
    folio plus each member reservation's own folios with balances. Use
    split_folio_charge / transfer tools to move value between a member's
    bill and the master — company pays the stay, guests pay their extras.


### `split_folio_charge(from_folio, charge_row, to_folio, percent, amount)`

Split one charge line between two folios of the same stay — e.g.
    a 70/30 corporate deal or a shared room. Give percent OR amount (the
    part that moves to to_folio). Use get_folio / reservation_folios to
    find folio and charge row names first.


### `update_occupants(reservation, occupants)`

Record everyone staying in the room (the legal hotel register,
    printed on the GRC). occupants = [{full_name, age, gender,
    nationality, id_type, id_number, phone}] — replaces the list.


### `set_room_rate(room_type, start_date, end_date, rate, reason)`

Set the nightly rate for a room type over a date range. Bounded by
    the owner's rate guardrails — the PMS rejects rates outside the
    floor/ceiling. Always give a reason (it goes in the audit trail).


### `owner_briefing(date)`

The owner's morning numbers: occupancy, yesterday's revenue/ADR/
    RevPAR, arrivals/departures, open tickets, next-7-day availability,
    agent hours saved. Turn this into a short, warm briefing — never
    change the figures.


### `setup_property(payload)`

Onboard a whole property in one call — the migration assistant's
    tool. Ask the hotel for their room list/rate card (any format), map
    it into: {property:{property_name, city, gstin?, phone?},
    room_types:[{code,name,base_price,adults?}], rooms:[{room_type_code,
    numbers:[..]}], meal_plans:[{code,price_per_adult}]}. Confirm the
    mapping with the user before calling.


### `import_bookings(bookings, property)`

Migrate existing reservations from another PMS/spreadsheet. Each:
    {guest_name, phone?, room_type_code, check_in, check_out, adults?,
    amount_after_tax?, channel?, status?}. Fixed amounts are preserved;
    otherwise the pricing engine quotes. Returns per-row errors — report
    them to the user rather than silently dropping rows.


### `send_payment_link(folio)`

Create a Razorpay payment link for a folio's outstanding balance
    (SMS/email to the guest when contact details exist).


### `run_night_audit(business_date)`

Run the end-of-day: post the night's room charges for in-house
    guests and flag no-shows. Idempotent per date.


### `create_group_block(group_name, check_in_date, check_out_date, blocks, company, cutoff_date, venue, event_type, event_date, attendees, customer_phone)`

Draft a MICE piece of business in one call: a group booking with a room
    block (list of {room_type, rooms_blocked, block_rate}) and optionally its
    banquet event. The agent wedge: turn "30 rooms + a 200-pax wedding on
    Dec 12" into a live proposal. Starts Open; confirming it holds the rooms
    out of general sale until the cutoff date.


### `group_pickup_status(group_booking)`

Group Rooms Control: the block, per-room-type pickup (blocked / picked
    up / remaining), rooming list, tied event and master folio.


### `pickup_group_room(group_booking, room_type, guest_name, phone)`

Name a guest into a group's room block — creates their reservation on
    the group's dates against the held inventory.
